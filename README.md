Objectives : Increased body mass index(BMI) is a risk factor for cardiovascular
diseases, however recent studies have reported better survival rates for patients with
higher BMI during a state of comorbidities such as cardiac surgery. The hypothesis is
gene loss of function variants(LOFs) associated with obesity and increased risk of
cardio-metabolic diseases may have predictive protective role in cardiovascular
surgical patients. This study aims to explore the differences in genetic variants and
their impacts in patients classified by their BMI categories.
Methods : Public transcriptome datasets were obtained from the National centre of
biotechnology information (NCBI)’s Gene expression omnibus database and were
utilized as the discovery cohorts for the detection and annotation of loss of function
(LOFs) variants with the use of bioinformatic tools and Genome Aggregation
Database(gnomAD). Statistical analysis was conducted with PLINK and the logistic
regression model was applied while adjusting for genetic stratification with top 5
principal components (PCA).
Results : A total of 69412 loss of function variants were detected, 16 were significant.
After controlling for genetic stratification, 3 out of 69, 412 loss of function variants were
significant( p<= 7.27e-7). Significant variants were validated in heart surgery patient’s
data to delineate obese and non-obese. Support vector classification machine learning
model was applied to predict the effects of the present identified variants using the
genotype in the surgery patient’s data.
Conclusion:In sum the data shows the identified LOFs NC_000019:10:g,1273549C>T) predicts obesity and the impact on collocated genes(CIRBP and FAM174C (C19orf24)) may have protective roles in surgical 
patients. Further research is necessary prior to developing therapeutic strategies.
